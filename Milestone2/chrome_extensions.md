I installed all of these extensions mentioned above in my chrome browser.

Why?
1. React developer tools: This extension helps to debug issues with React apps and to check the state.
2. Redux DevTools: This tool helps to check all the actions and state changes.
3. JSON Viewer: This tool helps to read the JSON format and makes it clear to understand.
