Tasks:

I choosed Windows Terminal with Powershell as my terminal client. Because it provides multiple tab support, increased customization, and improved Windows integration. While PowerShell offers a robust scripting environment for automation and system administration.

The basic Aliases are already installed like cat, ls, grep, cls etc. I installed PSReadLine plugin for history navigation and to highlight syntax.

The terminal is used to interact with the operating system and to run the scripts and commands. The basic terminal commands are:
pwd - To show the current directory.
ls - To list the files and directories in the current directory.
cd - To change between directories.
Touch - To create an empty file.
mkdir - To make a new directory.
rm - To remove the directories or files.
cp - To copy the files.
mv - To move the files.
cat - To display the contents of the file.
nano - To open a file for editing.
chmod - To change the file pemissions.
chown - To change the owner of the file.
ps - To check the running processes.
kill - To kill a running process.
grep - To search for a string in a file.
df - To check for disk space usage.

The command "grep" is used to find for a certain text string in a file. It is useful to check for error messages if we are working with large files.
