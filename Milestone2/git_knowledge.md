Tasks:

Git: Git is a distributed version control system which allows to have a local repository in our system. It makes collaboration easier and helps to track the changes in files.

Basic git commands:
1. Git add <file name>: This command stages the changes and prepare it to commit.
2. git commit -m "commit message": This command allows to add a commit message and saves the changes in the repository.
3. git branch: Shows all the branches.
4. git status: shows the current stage of the file.
5. git push: Push the local commits to the remote repository.
6. git pull: Fetches the changes from remote to local repository.
7. git merge: merge the changes from one branch to another.
8. git log: shows the commit history.
9. git clone <repository-URL>: This command creates the copy of a remote repository.

Yes, I have used git before. In my first semester, our class was assigned with one team project. On that time, i used git to collaborate with teams. 

I choose Git in VS code as it offers git operations directly from the editor and makes it easy to review the changes.

Git offers to create branches in a repository to separate their work which reduces the merge conflict issues. This is the most interesting thing.
