Tasks: 

I have CHATGPT and Github Copilot installed on my system. With the use fo AI, i can develop code snippets, ask for error check and also to learn a new topic. It is useful most of the time but human understanding is also crucial to go through a code before applying.

I tried CHATGPT to explain and understand the topics. To check for error and resolve the problem. To generate the code for particular tasks. I did not use Github Copilot but i will try to use it. Github Copilot is mainly used for code suggestions and can be used in Visual studio code.

CHATGPT is useful to generate the code explanantions, debug code and offers alternative solutions. Sometimes, the suggestions doesn't align with the questions. Also, same applies with Github Copilot, it provides accurate code suggestions but manual adjustments may also require.

AI is most useful in debugging the tasks, learning new concepts, code explanations and to automate the tasks.
