Research & Learn:

Agile Ceremonies: Agile ceremonies are organized meetings intended to facilitate cooperation, transparency and improvement among teams.
Daily Stand-ups: short meetings (15 minutes) where team members discuss their
workplan and shares progress.
Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban): Scrum is like planning
the sprints (fixed time periods) in advance. It provides a structured plan and the team
will work on planned tasks. In Kanban, the teams prioritize the tasks based on urgency
and team capacity which provides a flexible workflow.
Retrospectives: A retrospective is a planned meeting held at the end of the scrum or
Kanban where the team shows their work and pinpoints areas for improvement. It
encourages continuous learning.
Backlog Refinement: The team continuously evaluates, revises, and prioritize the
backlog of tasks which improves collaboration and reduce last-minutes changes.
Using Asynchronous communication, clear documentation and collaborative tools, the
agile teams can work across different time zones.

Reflection:

Daily stand-ups helps the team to keep on track about progress. Scrum & Kanban ensures the team knows what are the tasks need to proceed next. Retrospectives encourages feedback and Backlog refinement maintains the task's order and clarity.
Daily stand-ups ceremony is crucial for QA automation role as it requires alignment with the team to stay updated on new features and changes.
