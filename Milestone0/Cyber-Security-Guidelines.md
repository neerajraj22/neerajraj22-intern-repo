Reflection:

Current security practices: Strong passwords, Two-factor authentication, locking devices, avoiding to click on suspicious links and using up-to-date system.
Areas for improvement: Using password manager, automatic backups and checking account security settings.
Secure behaviour: Setup automatic security such as auto-lock, automatic software updates, regular backups. Use authenticator app and log out from the devices.
By updating passwords, using 2FA and password manager, log out from the shared devices.
Change or reset the password, review recent login activity and disconnect unknown devices, log out from all the devices and report the incident.

Task:

The Authenticator app is installed in my mobile phone to provide me one-time code to access my work accounts.
I have created an account on BitWarden password manager app.
My computer and mobile phone is set up to automatically lock my screen.
Using password manager to store and manage all passwords across different accounts.
