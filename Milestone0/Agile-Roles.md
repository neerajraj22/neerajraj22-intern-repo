Research & Learn: 

1. Key roles in an Agile team: 
    i) Developers: Build, test and maintain the code.
    ii) QA (Quality Assurance): Execute test cases, report and fix bugs to maintain quality 
    standards.
    iii) Product Manager (PM): Alignment with business objectives, communication with Agile 
    team and validate features.
    iv) Agile Project Manager (Agile PM): Facilitate Agile ceremonies and improve team 
    productivity and efficiency.
    v) Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support): Stakeholders provide 
    business expectation and give feedback. UX designers ensures the product is user- 
    friendly. Conduct user research to ensure a great customer experience. Customer 
    support reports the issues and complaints to the team to suggest improvements in 
    future updates.
2. In Scrum, developers work towards sprint goals. Product manager refines the tasks before any sprint planning. Agile project manager facilitates agile team. Other supporting roles provide feedback.
 In Kanban, they pull the tasks without sprint constraints. Product manager prioritize the tasks based on business needs. Agile project manager focuses on workflow and improves efficiency. Other roles can give feedback anytime.

Reflection: 

1. As a QA Automation role, my responsibilities will be to create, implement and manage automated test scripts to ensure the software quality at every stage of development cycle. My role contributes to the agile process by ensuring continuous testing, improves efficiency and reliability.

2. My responsibilities overlap and interact with these roles: 
i) Developers: Integrate automated tests, report bugs and improve code quality.
ii) Product manager: Test validation to ensure business needs are met.
iii) UX Designers: UI requirements for usability testing.
iv) Customer support: Maintain software reliability.
QA automation role ensures the reliability by integrating automated tests into agile workflows to enhance the product quality.

Task: 

1. By automating testing procedures, my role as a QA Automation ensures that the final product satisfies high quality standards. In order to enable faster releases with fewer problems, I integrate automated tests into the CI/CD process to provide constant feedback.  
2. I collaborate with QA automation team at the moment to work on the issues. To improve teamwork, i can enhance communication by regular meetings, sharing updates and getting feedback.
