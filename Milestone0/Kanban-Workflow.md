Agile Workflows & Kanban:

A Kanban board is a visual tool that tracks the progress of work items through several phases, assisting teams in managing tasks and workflows. It helps to manage workflow by organizing work into stages, track the status of each task and encourage focus.

Each columns represents a stage in the workflow.
Backlog: The list of unfinished or queued tasks.
To Do: Activities that have been chosen from the backlog and are prepared for execution.
In Progress: Activities being worked on at the moment.
Blocked: Tasks that are unable to proceed because of an issue.
Evaluation: Tasks under approval or evaluation.
Done: Tasks have been finished.

Task movement:
The task starts from backlog which is ready to be worked on. Then it moves to in
progress state whiich shows that the task is started and the assignee is working on it. If a
team member encounters issue related to the task, put it in blocked coloumn till the
issue is not resolved. If the task is completed, move it to done stage. The person
assigned to the task is responsible to update the board regularly.

Benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP):
The WIP restricts the number of tasks whiich are in progress state at the same time. It
increased the focus and better quality. The current task will be finished first before
starting new tasks which improves flow and speed.

Reflection:

Kanban helps to manage the tasks based on priorties. Teams can araange their tasks
based on the urgency of the tasks. Kanban follows WIP to avoid overload.

Improve the workflow using Kanban principles:
i) Use a board to see all the work.
ii) Focus on one or two tasks at a time.
iii) Break down the tasks and regularly review.

Task:

I checked one of the kanban board in windows app roadmap but i was not able to
create an task in there.
One way to improve task tracking is:
By regularly updating the task with proper description.
