Reflection:

Biggest benefits and challenges of Agile:
Benefits: Flexible, contionuous progress, enhances collaboration and risk management.
Challenges: Require proper organization, manage large organizations, require time and effort.

Agile can improve my role:
Agile helps in integrating testing, frequent feedback improves automation scripts, increase collaboration with team members and improves test automation.

Tasks:

Scrum is like a planned work for few weeks called as sprint which we have to complete in that particular sprint. Whereas Kanban doesn't involves a fixed time limit which makes it flexible and focuses on continuous delivery of tasks.

Clear and high-quality automated tests, it will easier later in adding features.
