Tasks:

Inspect.exe is installed and verified all these tasks: clicks a button and verifies the result automate typing into an input field and checking the entered value, handle modal dialogs and dropdown interactions.

Reflection:

WinAppDriver uses the WebDriver protocol, allowing you to interact with Windows applications. Run the WinAppDriver and writre the test scripts with the desired capabilities. Run the script. WinAppDriver sues find_element() commands to find UI elements.

Different Ways to Find Elements in WinAppDriver: 
AutomationId, name, XPath, Class Name, Control Type and Relative XPath.

How would you handle UI elements that load dynamically?
i) Use explicit and implicit waits.
ii) Polling checks at regular intervals to see if the button or any other element is
available as it saves the time.
iii) Handling Windows Popups.

Common Challenges When Automating Native Windows UI Interactions:
i) Dynamic UI elements.
ii) If the element's identifier changes between versions, it can break your automation
script.
iii) Popup Windows and application crashes.
iv) Complex control structures.
