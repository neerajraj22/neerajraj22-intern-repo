In a Git repository, a Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. Before merging code changes into the main project, developers can examine, discuss, and propose changes. A pull request is used for code review before merging, suggestion for improvements, tracking changes, allow automated tests and bug fixes.

When writing code, a Pull Request facilitates teamwork. It enables team members to examine modifications before to merging prevents errors. It enhances Code Quality. PRs document the reasons behind modifications. Before merging, automated tests can look for errors.

A well-structured PR is easy to read and understand. It includes a descriptive title, description, small changes that easy to review, tests and links to related issues.

i) Discussions are vital as developers provide feedback to make the code better.
ii) Changes must be explained: Provide an explanation for the adjustments they made.
iii) Testing Is Important: Verify that the new code has been properly tested.
iv) Small PRs are easier to review.

I created a new branch with name Branch1. I did a small change in my README.md file (added one extra comment). Added, committed and pushed to the Github. Added a meaningful title and description and merged the PR request to the main branch. Deleted the new branch.
