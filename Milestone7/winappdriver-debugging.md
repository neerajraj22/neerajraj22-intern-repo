Tasks:

Learn how to debug failing WinAppDriver tests using logs and screenshots:
Logs: Logs helps to capture important information for debugging failures. In the test code, we can set a log file path or use built-in login methods. Look for error messages in the log files. Us ethe logs before and after an action to perform.
Screenshots: Capturing a screenshot helps to visualize the app's state. Use screenshots when an dailure and exception occurs. Use it to compare the state of the application with UI behavior.

Retry logic and explicit waits behavior is explained in flaky tests tasks.

How do you determine if a test is flaky?
i) If the same test fails and passes.
ii) If the same test gives different results.
iii) Timing issues and network delays.
