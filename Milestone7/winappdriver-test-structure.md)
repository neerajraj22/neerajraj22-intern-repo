Best practices for structuring E2E test files:
i) Organize tests in a separate directory which makes them easier to manage and
navigate.
ii) Implementing the Page Object Model.
iii) Keep tests to be self-contained not reliant on the outcome of other tests.
iv) Each test should target a specific feature.

Key principles of maintainable E2E test code?
Easy to understand, reusability, Keep test logic separate from UI interactions, break
tests into smaller and focused parts and isolation.

Page Object Model (POM) improve test readability?
Encapsulates UI interactions and selector management.

Repetitive actions (like login steps) be moved to reusable helpers?
Dry principle, improves maintainability and consistency.

A well-structured test suite speed up debugging and test writing?
Easier to detect failure, faster development and better scalability.
