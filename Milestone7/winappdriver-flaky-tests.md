Common Causes of Flaky Tests in E2E Automation:

Timing issues.
Inconsistent network conditions.
Inconsistent test data.
Browser or Application State Issues.
Implicit waits: It is used for generic waits when it can not find an element. It avoids immediate test failure. Reduces the likelihood of encountering "element not found" errors.

Explicit waits: It is used when an specific action should be met before proceeding such as visibility, clickable and for specific text.

Stabilize Tests with Retry Logic: Retry logic helps to re-run the test automatically if they occasionally fails. Sometimes dependence on retry logic underlying issues which needs to be fixed. It can increase longer execution times.

Run Tests Multiple Times to Detect Inconsistencies: Running tests multiple times in different environments or conditions helps identify flakiness.

Strategies to Prevent Flaky Tests in Large Test Suites: Consistent Test Setup and Teardown methods, use stable locators, test isolation, retry logic and refactor.
