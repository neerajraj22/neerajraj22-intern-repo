Reflection questions:

1.  I want to gain hands-on experience based on my role. As i am pursuing Masters of cyber security course, i want to gain the experience related to threat analysis, penetration testing and defensive strategies. But as i am playing QA Automation role, i want to learn how to write automated test scripts, fixing errors, security testing and improving the software quality. If anything new thing i have to learn then i want to learn. 

2. I am excited to develop coding languages, different software test automation tools and security testing techniques.

3. I bring a passion for learning and applying my knowledge to the team. I have experience with networking and security concepts and operating system security. I can develop the skills if it needs in my role.

4. I want to gain more practical experience in coding languages, analyzing security breaches and automation frameworks.

5. The success in this internship means: Whatever work or tasks i have performed, i want to learn it practically. It does not matter if the task is something new to learn. I want to give my 100% to learn, i only need a way to learn. I want to develop good communication skills, build my confidence and most importantly, i want to develop my skills and knowledge by integrating with teams.
