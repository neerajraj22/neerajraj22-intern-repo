Steps:

Notes that feel confusing, frustrating and unclear:

Layout and Design: The privacy & security page layout post sign-in lacks padding and appears centered, which affects usability.

User Experience: The app's initial impression upon opening is confusing and could benefit from improved clarity in navigation and functionality.

Accessibility for ADHD Users: The app's structure may be challenging for users with ADHD due to its theoretical approach without practical implementation guidance.

Content Quality: The app's educational content could be more practical and grounded, providing a clearer foundational understanding rather than solely theoretical insights.

Response Time: Improvements are needed in response time to enhance user experience and clarity throughout the app.

Some ways to improve onboarding experience:

Clearer guidance: Using short instead of long blocks of text would make it more ADHD friendly.
Visual design & Navigation: The padding and spacing should be improved for readability.
Reflection questions:

The first impression of the app was confusing.

I did not find it clear which can help me to navigate through the app.

Focus bear is a app which is designed to help AuDHD or neurodivergent people to stay focused by minimizing distractions and sending reminders for their daily tasks.

Improvement based on ADHD user feedback:
Flexible Task Management Instead of Fixed Routines:
i) The current morning and evening routine structure may feel restrictive. Instead, a
full-day to-do list would be more beneficial, allowing users to add tasks freely (e.g.,
3, 4, or more).
ii) Users should be able to set time estimates for each task, and the app should
provide reminders when a task is approaching or when itâ€™s time to switch tasks.
iii) A completion notification sound would help users acknowledge progress.

Clear Task Prioritization:
i) ADHD users often struggle with deciding which task to start with. A simple to-do list
format where tasks are listed line by line would help with organization and
prioritization.

Active Reminders Instead of Silent Alerts:
i) Instead of subtle notifications, reminders should be more noticeable (with sound or
vibration) to keep users engaged and prevent distractions.

Simplified Feedback Process:
i) Users should not be required to write anything after completing a task.
ii) Instead, a quick multiple-choice question can be used to gather feedback efficiently
without adding extra cognitive load.
