Research & Learn:

In QA Automation role, AI tools are used to automate the testing and analysis of tasks which ensures the functionality , performance and security of applications such as Appium, TestComplete etc.
Benefits: It automates repetitive tasks and increased productivity. It analyzes the data quickly.
Risks: It reduces critical thinking, leakage of sensitive data and lack of transparency.
Confidential information which includes business data, financial details, passwords, bank account details, client information or any other sensitive data.
By cross-checking with trusted sources, official documentation, consistency across multiple sources and seek advice from supervisor.

Reflection:

Use AI to understand the concept and get the suggestions or ideas. To automate repetitive tasks and analyze the large amount of data. Use own skills when handling complex scenarios, debugging and strategic decisions.
AI can be used for repetitive tasks and efficiency but involvement in critical thinking should be maintained. Verify AI outputs ensures a balanced approach.
Avoiding to upload sensitive information, reviewing privacy policies and enable access controls.

Task:

Adding two numbers in C language using AI.
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int num1, num2, sum;

// Input two numbers
printf("Enter two numbers");
scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

// Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2;

// Display result
printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);

return 0;
}

The AI-generated output requires minor adjustments for better cross-platform compatibility. Sometimes the function may not work in some cases.
Always review and verify AI-generated outputs before implementation to ensure security and accuracy.
